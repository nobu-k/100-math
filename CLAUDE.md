# Git

- Keep history linear: use fast-forward merges or rebase (no merge commits).
- Delete branches after merging.
- Always ask for permission before running `git push`.

# Code Style

- Prefer arrow functions over regular functions.
- Follow Uncle Bob's stepdown rule: order functions so that higher-level functions appear before the lower-level functions they call. Each function should be followed by those at the next level of abstraction.
